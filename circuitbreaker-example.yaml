# Default mode setting for peers. If set to 'queue', htlcs that exceed limits
# are queued and forwarded later. If set to `queue_peer_initiated`, only htlcs

# failed. If set to 'fail', all htlcs exceeding limits are failed back
# instantly. If not set, mode defaults to 'fail'.

# does not inherit from the defaults above. So for example not setting a rate
# limit really means no rate limit, even if there is a default configured.
